# Rock Paper Scissors Game - Python Project
## Project Description
This project aims to create the classic "Rock Paper Scissors" game using the Python programming language. In the game, a showdown occurs between the player and the computer. The game ends when either the player or the computer wins two out of the first three rounds, and the winner is determined. The game ends when the user and the computer decide whether to continue playing after the game ends.

## Rules
### 1.Game Options:
* Rock beats scissors.
* Scissors beat paper.
* Paper beats rock.

### 2.Game Flow:
* The game ends when either side wins the first two rounds.
* After each game, both the user and the computer are asked if they want to continue playing.
* If both sides want to continue, the game continues with new rounds.
* To exit the game, you can type "exit".

# Setup
To run this project, follow these steps:

### 1.Python Must Be Installed:
* This game is compatible with Python 3.x. If Python is not already installed, you can download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2.Running the Game:
* Download the project files to your computer.
* Open a terminal or command prompt.
* Navigate to the directory containing the file and run the `tas_kagit_makas_GULSAH_BASKURT.py` file using the following command:
    ```shell
  python tas_kagit_makas_GULSAH_BASKURT.py
    ```

## Usage
When the game starts, the rules and instructions will be displayed on the screen. The player makes a choice by typing either rock, paper, or scissors. The game ends when either the player or the computer wins two out of the first three rounds. After the game ends, you will receive a message asking if you want to continue. If you do not want to continue, type 'h'; if you want to continue, type 'e'.

## Project Features
* **User Input:** The player makes a choice of rock, paper, or scissors via the keyboard.
* **Random Selection:** The computer's choice is determined randomly using the random module.
* **Round Count:** The rounds between the player and the computer are tracked, and scores are displayed on the screen.
* **Victory Messages:** After each round, a special message is shown to the winning side.

## Requirements
No external libraries are used in this project. The game is developed using Python's standard libraries.
